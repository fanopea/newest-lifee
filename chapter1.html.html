  <p> On a hot summer day, A man, seeming to be in his 30s, and a little girl, no older than 8, are seen conversing right before a crosswalk. Both holding an item in their, A grocery bag in the man's and a tub of ice cream in the girl's. The little girl is eager to cross quickly, enthusiastically talking about a Anniversary of something while the older male is keenly listening to the little girl's fantasies. As the traffic light turns a bright red color, they begin crossing while engrossed in their conversation, not noticing the semi-truck coming full speed at them. At the halfway point, the adult finally noticing the truck barreling towards them does not have even enough time to recognize what is heading towards them, as the truck nears closer and closer and closer and closer....  
  <p><B> *CRASH!* </B> phsst! phsst! The mind-numbing sound of rain fills the air, Concealing the muttering and gossip of the surrounding. The earthy smell of rain further covering the smell of burning  gasoline and flesh. The man quickly taking the girl into his arms, holding her as if she would disappear if he let go. Realizing that if the truck hadn't swerved last second both him and the girl would've died on the spot.<br><br> Confused, the girl questioned, " Uncle Joe! why did that truck crash into that mall?".<br><br> The man, now identified as joe, seemed to be snap out of his stupor," maybe he was sleepy, you know sometimes truck drivers go days without sleep.<br><br> "Hmmm, really?" , asked the little girl, not believing it fully.<br><br> "yes, truck drive-<b> wait! </b> I told you not to call me uncle joe, Alice . it's uncle joeseph, got it!?" Yelled the man, now correctly identified as Joseph, in a somewhat embarrassed manner.<br><br>"but why? Uncle Joe sounds cuter!" complaining the girl, named alice, started pouting.<br><br> Joseph now with a sweat drop rolling down his face decides that arguing with a child is too exhausting, " Ugh! just leave it. let's go home now." while taking out an umbrella from his bag <Br><br> "yay! Mom's gonna be soo surprised when she sees the ice cream!" Alice yelled with an excited smile on her face, waving the tub of ice cream in her hand.<br><br> Joseph not paying attention, is desperately trying and failing to unfurl the umbrella, "yeah, she sure will be". <br><br> After a while of trying and failing, Joeseph, finally succeeded in unfurling the umbrella and protecting himself and Alice from the freezing rain.

<h2> <U> Some Time Later </U> </h2>
<p> Joseph & alice are seen entering the front yard of a house. The house while modest gave a warm and comfy feeling to the duo. Inside. people could be seen cooking, decorating, conversing and having fun. As the two opened the doors, they yelled in unison," We're back!". Closing the door, Joseph was greeted by his sister and alice's mother. Liz Carter could be defined by one word, confident. She was a perfect child, always excelling in her grades and being at the top of their class, no the entire state of florida. <b> But </B> to Joseph she was nothing but a former shell of herself.<p> "what took you so long?" asked liz, impatiently tapping her foot.<br> <br> Joespeh looking around as if looking for someone, replied sarcastically "I don't know maybe the fact that we almost died?"<br> <br> "Are you serious?" Asked liz, this time glaring as if she was trying to burn a hole through him with just her mind. <br> <br> Alice feeling left out of the conversation, interjected "We did! There was this huge truck that was comming towards us but it turned away at the last moment!"<br> <br> Taking her eyes off her daughter, liz turned back to Joeseph," You know, this is the last time I'm letting you go out with alice, right?"<br> <br> Putting away his umbrella, Joseph sighed "That works just fine, turns out a kid is to high energy for me."<br> <br> Remembering the ice cream, alice put the tub of ice cream right in front of liz's face "Mom! look we got ice cream!". <br> <br> Liz, now in a passive aggressive tone, replies "Ice cream too? Yeah, you're going to be lucky to even meet her" <br> <br> Ushering Alice away into her room, joseph closed the door, " yeah yeah, tell it to someone to cares" <br> <br> "luv, where's the barbecue sauce?", An unfamiliar voice called out from the kitchen. <br> <br> Liz taking a long breath and exhalimg it out in a long drawn out sigh, replied "Its in the fridge, honey!". <br> <br> "See! I told ya, ya dumbass!", another unfamiliar voice yelled along with a chorus of laughter. Ushering Alice away into her room, Joseph turned around to face liz again, " I'm telling you, divorce that guy! I mean, we literally told you guys several times, not to bring non-family members!"<br> <br> liz's face deforming into snarl replied," How many times do I have to tell you NO! I'm not divorcing him, So what if he brings friends to a 'family event', I love Rob and Rob loves me!" <br> <br> Joseph now groaning in frustration "ughhhhh, You literally gave your dream job to marry him and became a house wife! You could've done so much more in life!" <br> <br> Liz, who was already at her last straws, finally snapped,"LIKE DAD WOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN LIFE!". Storming away like a category five hurricane, it was clear that Both had crossed a line that should not have been crossed. Stunned and hurt, Joeseph was left alone with just himself and his thoughts, 'but really on dad's anniversary

<p> On a dinner table, a variety of dishes were spread all across the very long dinner table with chairs surrounding the entire the table. A number of guest were conversing, making toasts, eating and drinking (Alcohol). Among them joeseph was alone, quietly eating his food at the corner the table. Despite being the anniversary of a dear family member's death, everyone seemed to forget about the him and focus on indulging in themselves. Reflecting on what had happened earlier, Joeseph finally decided on what to do. 'I'll ignore it!!', With that decided, Joeseph started to devour his plate with the ferocity of a wild boar.<br> <br> " Ooooh! Is it just me or does it smell like rotten eggs?", Rob said While pinching his nose. Getting up from his seat, Rob clarified, "Whatever, its time for some B-<b> *BOOM* </b>. A fiery explosion welled up from the stove along with a loud roar that left a ringing sound. With lightning fast reflexes, Joseph quickly shielded alice with his own body. Startled, alice asked," uncle joe, why'd you do that?. Only to see the destruction that had unfolded. Fires spreading throughout the house could be seen even from downstairs. Joseph, covered with severe burns throught out his body, picked alice up into his arms," Come on we need to get out of here. "What about mom?" questioned alice, pointing at the limp body of liz. "I'll come back to get her okay?", Joseph replied, trying to get out of the burning house with alice as soon as possible. <br> <br> Reaching the front door, Joeseph tried to unlock the door but failed as the door knob was to hot to touch. In situations such as these, Joseph would ask himself one question, WWDD or 'what would dad do?'. With that in mind, Joeseph threw himself aganist the door and succeeded in opening it. landing the soft grass joeseph got up and looked to see if alice and okay. After confirming, he entered the burning house again, leaving alice in the care of a bystander. One after another joeseph had begun slowly evacuating everyone from the fire pit, formerly a house. 'Only Rob's left now!', Once a again entering the burning building, Joeseph spotted the man. Quickly picking the grown man, Joeseph flung him outside an open window and just as he was about to also jump out himself. <Br> <br> <B> *CRASH* </b>"ARGHHHH!", Joeseph screamed out in pain as his legs get crushed by the ceiling collapsing on him. "huff huff, I don't think I'm gonna make it", joeseph wheezed out to no one particularly. His Lungs burning due to the smoke and ash in the air. Wheezing, joseph started reminiscing about the days when his dad and him would watch <b> that show </b>. 'Huh, wish I could've finished it' with that thought Joeseph Carter took his <b> last breath </b>.
